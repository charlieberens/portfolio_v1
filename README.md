Hey, you've found my portfolio. How neat.

## Inception
I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp5WWtMoeKg "Coding Adventure: Ray Marching") by [Sebastian Lague](https://github.com/SebLague "Sebastian Lague") about Ray Marching, a more performant rendering alternative to Ray Tracing. Since I priamrily program for the web, I created an implementation in WebGl. 

It didn't crash my pc with integrated graphics, so I decided that it was quick enough to be used in a portfolio. The blending effect is the result of a function that smoothly takes the minimum of two distance estimators.

## Tech
- **WebGL** (all ray-marching code is written in GLSL)
- A small amount of **Three.JS**
- **Gatsby**
- **React**
- **Sass**
- Hosted on **Netlify**
